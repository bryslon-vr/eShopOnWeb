# eShopOnWeb
This is the public repository i created.

An existing eShopOnWeb repository is imported and is organized the following way:
•	.ado folder contains Azure DevOps YAML pipelines.
•	.devcontainer folder container setup to develop using containers (either locally in VS Code or GitHub Codespaces).
•	infra folder contains Bicep&ARM infrastructure as code templates used in some lab scenarios.
•	.github folder container YAML GitHub workflow definitions.
•	src folder contains the .NET 8 website used on the lab scenarios.

I've changed the settings to allow all actions and resusable workflows on the repo.
